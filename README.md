# Machine Learning Image Classification Project:
* Given training images (28 x 28 pixels) of different clothing items (Tshirt, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, etc. )
* Used Keras Sequential Neural Network Model of Tensor Flow to accurately predict 10,000 pieces of unidentified clothing item at 90% accuracy
